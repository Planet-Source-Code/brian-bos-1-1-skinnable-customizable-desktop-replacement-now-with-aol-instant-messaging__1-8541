When BoS is installed, the standard windows taskbar, start menu, and desktop icons don't show up; insted, they are replaced with
BoS's desktop icons, start menu, and taskbar.
Here's how to install BoS:
- Compile the project into B.exe 
- Go to Start > Run
- Type in "C:\windows\system.ini" and press enter 
- Find the section that says "shell=explorer.exe".
- Change it to "shell=<< FULL Path to B.exe >>". 
  IMPORTANT NOTE: The path to BoS must conform to the 8.3 naming scheme. If you don't know what the 8.3 naming scheme is, just install
  BoS in C:\bos
- Reboot your computer 
If, for any reason, you make a spelling mistake and BoS doesn't come up, press Control-Escape - from there just follow instructions 2-6
 
Begone, evil Windows desktop icons and start menu! Hello, BoS
